Optional paramenters are:

-Ddownload.folder=<download folder path>
Default value is "D:/outputScript/DWH/scartati/" (please remember always final slash)

Example:
java -Dconnection.url=jdbc:oracle:thin:@127.0.0.1:1521:ORC -Dconnection.user=ZU -Dconnection.password=TRYME -Dsql.filename=/home/zu/query.sql -Ddownload.folder=/home/zu/blobs/ -jar downloadblob-1.0.0.jar

File with query SQL has to return 7 columns:

       ,'hello.txt' as ORIGINALFILENAME
       ,'ZU' as PARTNER
       ,'001' as REFERENCE
       ,'OK' as STATUS
       ,sysdate as TIMESTAMP
       ,sysdate as ANOTHER_DATE
